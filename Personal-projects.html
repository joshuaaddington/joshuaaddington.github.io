        This is a project that I am currently working on. The goal is to build a self-balancing robot using an ESP32 microcontroller.
        It uses a combination of gyroscope and accelerometer data to determine its orientation and drives two brushless DC motors to maintain balance.
        The motor driver and control system use FOC (Field Oriented Control) and PID algorithms to achieve smooth motor control and stability.
        I built the battery using 18650 lithium-ion cells and a BMS (Battery Management System) to ensure safe operation. Currently, I'm running into issues with
        the magnetic motor position encoders, which are interfering with proper motor control.

        I designed and built a custom split mechanical keyboard using a hand-soldered logic matrix and an RP2040 microcontroller.
        The base is laser-cut and the key-plate is 3D printed. The keyboard features a QMK firmware implementation that allows for custom key mappings and macros.
        The project was based on the <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs/tree/main/Scotto44">Scotto44</a> keyboard design.

        I learned the basics of web development by building this personal website using HTML, CSS, and Jekyll.
        The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and the source code is available on this <a class="inline-link" href="https://github.com/joshuaaddington/joshuaaddington.github.io">GitHub repository</a>.

        In a manufacturing processes course, I worked with a team to design and build a single-cylinder air engine. We used a variety of manufacturing
        methods, including manual milling and turning, metal casting, and powdered metallurgic sintering.
        We were able to successfully run the air engine at pressures as low as 9 psi.
