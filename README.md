Hi! I'm **Joshua Addington**, a mechanical engineering student at Brigham Young University, graduating in **August 2025**. I have a strong passion for **mechatronics, robotics, and control systems**, and I enjoy working on complex, hands-on projects that combine mechanical design, electronics, and software.  

I made this portfolio to show off some of my skills and projects that I've worked on
