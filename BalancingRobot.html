<h1>Balancing Robot</h1>
    <p> 
        As I'm interested in robotics and control systems, I am currenty working on a segway-style balancing robot. I've designed it to use an ESP32 microcontroller, which processes data from a gyroscope and accelerometer to maintain balance. The robot uses two brushless DC motors for movement, controlled via a motor driver that implements Field Oriented Control (FOC) and PID algorithms for smooth operation.
        The robot is powered using a battery that is built using 18650 lithium-ion cells with a BMS (battery management system) to ensure safe operation. The design uses two boards, a main board that does calculations for the control system and a motor driver board that monitors the motor position and drives them using the FOC algorithm implemented with a library salled SimpleFOC. 
        The two boards communicate wirelessly using the ESP-NOW protocol, allowing for data exchange between the two without slowing the FOC control loop. The main board also has a Bluetooth module for remote control and monitoring.
        Currently I'm working to resolve issues with the magnetic motor position encoders. They communicate via I2C, but they are intended for 5V microcontrollers, so they will need replacing as the ESP32 operates at 3.3V.
