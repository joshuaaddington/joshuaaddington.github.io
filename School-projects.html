        This project aimed to create a surrogate model that predicts drone propeller performance (thrust per watt) 
        based on a range of design inputs. A Design of Experiments (DOE) approach was used to sample 
        a variety of geometries and operating conditions. The data generated from physical tests was 
        used to fit a hyper-surface which could be used to predict the performance of other propeller geometries.

        During my senior year, I had the opportunity to take a course on control systems design. 
        The course was comprised of a series of case studies as well as a physical lab. 
        For each of these case studies, I modeled the system behavior using Lagrangian dynamics 
        and implemented control using both PID and state-space controllers, all with tools in Python such as SymPy and NumPy.

        In this course, I learned about the fundamentals of robotics, including forward and inverse kinematics,
        trajectory planning, dynamics, and control. The course was mainly focused on the mathematical modeling of robotic systems,
        but also had a lab component where I implemented some of the concepts using an industrial robotic arm. The majority of the modeling and
        mathematics was done using Python libraries like SymPy and NumPy, and we used ROS2 for the lab component.

        In a manufacturing processes course, I worked with a team to design and build a single-cylinder air engine. We used a variety of manufacturing
        methods, including manual milling and turning, metal casting, and powdered metallurgic sintering.
        We were able to successfully run the air engine at pressures as low as 9 psi.

        This project involved designing and building a line following robot using a PIC24 microcontroller. We were able to use PD control in conjunction
        with infrared sensors to achieve a robust line following behavior. The project was a great deep-dive into embedded systems as we started from first principles 
        such as oscillators, bit registers, op-amp circuits, analog to digital conversion, and more.
