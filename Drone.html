title: Drone Propeller DOE Surrogate Model
---

<h1>Drone Propeller DOE Surrogate Model</h1>
    <p> 
        This project aimed to create a surrogate model that predicts drone propeller performance (thrust per watt) based on a range of design inputs. A Design of Experiments (DOE) approach was used to sample a variety of geometries and operating conditions. The data generated from physical tests was then used to fit a hyper-surface which could be used to predict the performance of other propeller geometries.

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Procedure Applied:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A Python script using the Fusion 360 API was developed to procedurally generate propeller geometries.</li>
        <li>Latin hypercube sampling (a DOE technique) was used to generate a representative set of 27 unique geometries.</li>
        <li>These propellers were 3D printed and tested under controlled conditions to measure thrust and power consumption.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Skills Applied:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Python (NumPy, matplotlib, scipy.stats)</li>
        <li>DOE techniques (full factorial, Latin hypercube sampling)</li>
        <li>Data visualization and interpretation</li>
        <li>3D CAD modeling, printing, and physical testing</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Key Outcomes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Built and validated a surrogate model that was able to explain 83% of the variance in the data</li>
        <li>Demonstrated the potential for using surrogate modeling to significantly reduce the time and cost of optimizing propeller designs.</li>
    </ul>
