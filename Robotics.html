<h1>Me En 537: Robotics</h1>
    <p> 
        In this course, I learned about the fundamentals of robotics, including forward and inverse kinematics,
        trajectory planning, dynamics, and control. The course was mainly focused on the mathematical modeling of robotic systems,
        but we also had a lab component where we implemented some of the concepts using a robotic arm. The majority of the modeling and 
        mathematics was done using Python libraries like sympy and numpy, and we used ROS2 for the lab component.
