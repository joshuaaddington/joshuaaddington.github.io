title: Line Following Robot
---

<h1>Line Following Robot</h1>
    <p> 
        This project involved designing and building a line following robot using a PIC24 microcontroller. We were able to use PD control in conjunction
        with infrared sensors to achieve a robust line following behavior. The project was a great deep-dive into embedded systems as we started from first principles 
        such as oscillators, bit registers, op-amp circuits, analog to digital conversion, and more.
