# Joshua Addington - Mechanical Engineer | Electro-mechanical systems 

Hi! I'm **Joshua Addington**, a mechanical engineering student at BYU, graduating in **August 2025**. I have a passion for **mechatronics, controls, and systems engineering**, and I enjoy working on complex, hands-on projects that combine mechanical design, electronics, and software. In my free time I love to backpack, rock climb, and tinker on projects at home.

I made this portfolio to show off some of my skills and projects that I've worked on.
