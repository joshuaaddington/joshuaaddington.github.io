<h1>Single Cylinder Air Engine</h1>
    <p> 
        In a manufacturing processes course, I worked with a team to design and build a single-cylinder air engine. We used a variety of manufacturing
        methods, including manual milling and turning, metal casting, and powdered metallurgic sintering.
    </p>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Procedure Applied:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed, toleranced, and determined hole fits for engine components</li>
        <li>Created 3D CAD models of the engine components using Solidworks</li>
        <li>Used manual milling and turning to create the engine components, achieving precise tolerances and surface finishes to ensure proper function and assembly</li>
        <li>Created molds and cast metal parts for the flywheel assembly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Skills Applied:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manual machining (milling, turning)</li>
        <li>Metal casting and mold making</li>
        <li>Powdered metallurgic sintering</li>
        <li>3D CAD modeling (Solidworks)</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Key Outcomes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Successfully designed and manufactured a functional single-cylinder air engine capable of maintaining motion at pressures as low as 9 psi.</li>
        <li>Gained hands-on experience with a variety of manufacturing processes and techniques.</li>
    </ul>
