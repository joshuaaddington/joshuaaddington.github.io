<h1>Capstone: AI-Powered Parts Database Search</h1>
    <p> 
        In this capstone project, I was part of a team that developed an AI-powered search tool for a parts database. 
        The goal was to improve the efficiency of finding specific parts for engineers working at a major biomedical device company.
        At a high level, the tool used a rendering engine to generate images of 3D CAD models, evaluated them using a CLIP model, and then
        compared user queries to the parts database using a cosine similarity score to return the most relevant results.

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Procedure Applied:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Designed and implemented a user-friendly interface for the search tool.</li>
        <li>Utilized NLP techniques to process and understand user queries.</li>
        <li>Developed a recommendation system using collaborative filtering methods.</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Skills Applied:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Computer Vision(Marqo, CLIP)</li>
        <li>API integration (FreeCAD, Blender, Marqo)</li>
        <li>Server and application integration (Docker, http server-client communication)</li>
    </ul>

    <p style="font-weight: bold;">Key Outcomes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gained practical experience in applying AI techniques to real-world problems.</li>
        <li>Achieved a significant improvement in search efficiency and user satisfaction.</li>
    </ul>
